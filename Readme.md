# Requirements

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

# Starting

To download, intialize and run KorAP pointing to a certain directory index
(in this example `myindex` in the local directory), run

```shell
$ INDEX=./myindex docker-compose up
```

This will make the frontend be available at
`localhost:64543`.
