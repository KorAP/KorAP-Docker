      "message": "I added the hint, that compose is required to be installed as a CLI plugin. v2 was required before as per readme. Regarding the version: I have no idea, if this changes anything regarding the dependency behaviour. I just remember it was a bit version dependent, if the order was followed strictly when I first set up the compose file. Would be nice if that\u0027s no longer the case.",

      "message": "The `docker-compose` notation doesn\u0027t indicate that it is the v1 python script. The go executable is also written like that - and works standalone as well. The installation guide as a CLI plugin was introduced later (I guess when docker started to support CLI plugins that way) - I always used it directly as a binary, but we can switch to the now recommended plugin-installation.",
